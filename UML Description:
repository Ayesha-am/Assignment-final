UML Description:
The UML class diagram represents the relationships between five main classes: User, Customer, Admin, Ticket, and TicketingSystemGUI. The User class is a parent class, and both Customer and Admin inherit from it, indicated by hollow triangle arrows pointing from Customer and Admin to User. The Customer class has an aggregation relationship with the Ticket class, as shown by a hollow diamond on the Customer side, with a multiplicity of 1 near Customer and 0..* near Ticket, meaning a customer can have zero or more tickets. The Admin class is associated with the Ticket class, shown as a plain line, where the multiplicity is 0..* near Ticket, indicating an admin can manage multiple tickets. The TicketingSystemGUI class composes the Customer, Admin, and Ticket classes, represented by filled diamonds near the TicketingSystemGUI. The multiplicity 1 near TicketingSystemGUI and 0..* near Customer and Admin highlights that the GUI manages multiple customers and admins. For the Ticket class, the composition shows that the GUI must manage at least one ticket, represented by the multiplicity 1..*. This illustrates the relationships and interdependencies between the classes, clearly showing inheritance, aggregation, association, and composition with proper arrows and multiplicities.
