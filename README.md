Final Assignment

Scenario:
The Adventure Land Theme Park is a popular destination for families and thrill-seekers, attracting millions of visitors each year. As the park continues to expand and introduce new attractions, it has identified the need for a comprehensive ticket booking system to streamline the purchasing process, enhance visitor experience, and manage attendance effectively.
The new system will allow guests to purchase tickets online and at the park, manage reservations, and access real-time information about attractions, events, and park services. The ticket booking system will include several types of tickets, such as single-day passes, multi-day passes, annual memberships, and group discounts. It will maintain a user-friendly online platform where visitors can select their preferred ticket type, choose a visit date, and make payments through various methods, including credit cards and digital wallets.
